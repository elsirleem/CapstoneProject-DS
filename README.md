As a starting point of almost all data science projects, this project involves the need to collect data, as much and relevant as possible.
Data is collected from various sources. After the raw data has been collected, the quality of the data is improved by performing data wrangling. 
Then the data exploration is been carried out on the processed data. This project provided a hands-on practice on skills such as the SQL skills to query the data and gather insights.  

It also provide further insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization, which helps to show directly how variables might be related to each other.   

Practical experience on the methods to build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights were covered. 

The final task of this capstone project was to create a presentation that will be developed into stories of all the analysis that was carried out in the project.
